export default `Hi,

Welcome to Notedown. Here you can edit this text to put anything you want like todo list, stuff you don't want to loose, ideas, reminders, etc.
Notedown will simply add some syntax coloration to your writings (just like a code editor).


# Here're some examples

You can put some text *and* "add" ~styling~.
You can use (parenthesis), [brackets] // and comments

Links are clickable. Simply press [CMD] or [CTRL] and click on the link.
Try out https://google.com

And mostly, you can create tasks:

- [ ] This is a simple item
- [x] This one is done
- [√] It also works with √ char
- [-] This one is canceled
- [?] Use "?" to make it looks like a warning
- [!] And "!" to make it looks urgent
    - [ ] Yes you can indent
        - [x] Keep indenting
        - [ ] And combine everything (parenthesize)
        - [ ] And everything [brackets https://google.com]


# How to save your notes?

There is no save button, simply write your stuff.
At any time, you can leave this page and come back later. Your notes will be there, waiting to be updated.
If you want to use your notes across multiple devices, use the [sign in] button on the top right corner. You'll be asked to connect your Google account and authorize Notedown. Data are stored on Firebase and you are the only one who can access them.


# Shortcuts

Because Notedown is inspired by code editors, you can use shortcuts.
- [CMD + Z] Undo
- [CMD + SHIFT + Z] Redo
(more to come)


# The project

Notedown is an open source project and it's still in development.
